                    </div>

                    <p>Densely populated areas (New York City, for instance) typically have high mortgage/rental costs. 
                        As the demand for these living spaces increases, so do the associated costs. For low-income households, 
                        this presents a challenge as their income is not sufficient to meet the skyrocketing prices. It is only a 
                        matter of time then before they will need to relocate to other accommodations.
                    </p>

                    <p>This project highlights the need for affordable housing costs. Given a selection of variables, it requires that 
                        students design a program that determines if a resident will be able to afford living in such an area after some 
                        amount of time.

                    <p>Heart disease is among the leading causes of death in the United States. 
                        To prevent this illness, medical experts recommend monitoring your dietary intake and 
                        making decisions that promote a healthy lifestyle.
                    </p>

                    <p>This project challenges students to design a program that serves as health tracker to 
                        indicate whether or not a person is at risk for heart disease.

                    <p>This project challenges students to examine the impact of excessive waste production on land usability 
                        and how it diminishes our finite natural resources.

                    <p>Recent surges in the demand for electricity have prompted 
                        states to implement new ways of generating power. One such measure is 
                        the use of solar batteries—clean energy sources that utilize sunlight for 
                        dispensing electricity.
                    </p>

                    <p>This project is ideal for introducing lists or 1D arrays. The objective is 
                        for students to use these data structures to determine if the supply from a 
                        solar battery is sufficient in meeting the demand for electricity based on the 
                        criteria provided.

                    </div>

                    <p>Farmers have always relied on aquifers to irrigate their crops. In recent years, however, 
                        overuse of these underground water supplies has led to severe depletion. Since more water 
                        is being pumped than replenished, it is only a matter of years until this resource is completely 
                        drained. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Proper regulation when it comes to managing natural resources is key to ensuring that they last 
                        for future generations—this is is the main idea that this project hopes to covey to students as 
                        they are designing their program.

                    </div>

                    <p>A psychological study suggests that people tend to gravitate towards others who share similar interests. 
                        To build on this idea, consider a neighborhood made up of dog and cat owners. Over time, dog owners would 
                        prefer to live near their fellow dog owners, and the same could be true for cat owners as well.
                    </p>

                    <p>This project makes use of 2D arrays. Students are to simulate a neighborhood change over the course of a year 
                        utilizing a two-dimensional grid and the “rules” to follow for relocating residents.

                    <p>During their yearly migration, monarch butterflies follow a 
                        trail of milkweed plants positioned in various regions across North America. 
                        These plants not only serve as food and shelter for these insects, but also provide 
                        scientists with key insights into migration patterns.
                    </p>

                    <p>This project requires the use of 2D arrays. It prompts students to design a program that 
                        acts as a compass for humans to follow based on the location of milkweed plants situated 
                        across the grid.

                    <p>A trip to the grocery store can become a hassle if lengthy distances and inadequate 
                        means of transportation are considered. For residents living in areas with limited 
                        access to a grocery store/pantry, this could present a problem that could impact their diet.
                    </p>

                    <p>This project tests students&apos; ability to process scalars and basic data structures. They are 
                        to write a program that considers a set of variables pertaining to a grocery/pantry trip. 
                        The program is to print out calculations pertaining to distance, accessibility, and mode 
                        of transportation needed.

                    <p>Using data acquired from Kaggle.com, this project requires students to design 
                        a program that outputs a health score. This score is calculated using various 
                        factors such as age, weight, cholesterol level, etc. The idea is for the program to 
                        act as health tracker, informing the user about how healthy they are based on the inputs given. 
                    </p>

                    <p>The higher the score, the closer the person is to developing heart disease or other forms of illness.

                        In rural areas, for instance, where residents live more than 10 miles from the nearest grocery store, 
                        this presents a challenge for meeting their nutritional needs. This is especially so for when residents 
                        have a limited access to transportation and/or are of a low-income status.
                    </p>
