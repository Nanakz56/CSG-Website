                <p>
                Focused on bringing enrichment to computer science course curricula, Computing for the 
                Social Good is a research area that challenges students to think critically about how their 
                learning relates to pressing social issues. It reinforces the idea that computer scientists at their 
                core are problem-solvers—what better way to build upon this notion than by having students 
                reflect on these problems and propose plausible solutions?
                </p>
                <p>Currently, the research area is targeted towards introductory level computer science courses, 
                with emphasis on connecting every project to some real-world social crisis. The contents of 
                this website showcase just this—with links to download programming projects that were 
                developed to be both informative and engaging. Additionally, our collection of data sets 
                features a wide range of fields that are worth exploring. Lastly, to delve deeper into the 
                research area, consider browsing the bibliography page for in-dept analysis from experienced 
                teaching faculty.</p>

                    <p>Recent surges in the demand for electricity have prompted states to implement 
                        new ways of generating power. One such measure is the use of solar batteries—clean energy 
                        sources that utilize sunlight for dispensing electricity.</p>

                    <p>This project is ideal for introducing lists or 1D arrays. The objective is for students to 
                        use these data structures to determine if the supply from a solar battery is sufficient in 
                        meeting the demand for electricity based on the criteria provided.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>  During their yearly migration, monarch butterflies follow a trail of milkweed plants positioned 
                        in various regions of North America. These plants not only serve as food and shelter for these insects, 
                        but also provide scientists with key insights into migration patterns.</p>

                    <p>This project requires the use of 2D arrays. It prompts students to design a program that acts as a compass 
                    for humans to follow based on the location of milkweed plants situated across the grid.</p>

                    <p>Heart disease is among the leading causes of death in the United States. To prevent this illness, medical experts 
                        recommend monitoring your dietary intake and making decisions that promote a healthy lifestyle.</p>

                    <p>This project focuses solely on scalars. It challenges students to design a program that serves as health tracker to 
                        indicate whether or not a person is at risk for heart disease.</p>
